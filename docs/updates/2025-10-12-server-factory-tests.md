- Refactored `createMCPServer` to expose `createServerWithDependencies`, enabling dependency injection for handler testing.
- Added integration-style specs for `aw_get_activity`, `aw_get_calendar_events`, `aw_query_events`, and `aw_get_raw_events` response variants.
- Introduced `createHttpServer` so the Express transport can be instantiated in tests; covered `/health` and `/admin/reload-server` lifecycle behaviour.
- Added schema unit tests for `GetCalendarEventsSchema` (custom range validation) and defaults in `QueryEventsSchema`.

- Introduced `ServerDependencies` and `ServerLifecycleOptions` interfaces in `src/server-factory.ts`; factored startup logic into `createServerWithDependencies`.
- Added `tests/integration/server-factory.test.ts` covering concise/detailed/raw tool branches via injected services.
- Refactored `src/http-server.ts` to expose `createHttpServer` and added `tests/integration/http-server.test.ts` using ephemeral Express instances.
- Added `tests/unit/tools/schemas.test.ts` verifying custom-range requirements and defaults in `src/tools/schemas.ts` (with corresponding schema refinements).

- Facilitates targeted handler tests without spinning up the full HTTP transport.
- Enables HTTP lifecycle verification (health/reload) without binding to a fixed port.
- Ensures schema regressions are caught early for custom ranges and default parameters.
- No production behaviour changes; stdio/HTTP startup flows unchanged.

## Validation
- `npm run test:unit` *(passes locally; sandbox invocation still exits early without diagnostics).* 
- `npm run test:integration`

## Follow-ups / TODOs
- Extend coverage to HTTP transport lifecycle once factory seam is leveraged there.
- Consider snapshotting representative handler responses for regression tracking.
