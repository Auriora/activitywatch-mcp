## Summary
- Renamed the codebase from `activitywatch-mcp` to `activitywatch-mcp` to align with current branding and distinguish from community forks.
- Updated public-facing docs and config samples to reference the new GitHub slug `auriora/activitywatch-mcp` and GHCR image tags.
- Noted remaining historical references confined to archived documentation for lineage.

## Changes
- Updated package metadata, Docker compose services, GHCR image names, and example configs to use `activitywatch-mcp`.
- Refreshed README, quickstart, developer docs, and security/contact details with the new repository slug and paths.
- Verified non-archival files for lingering `activitywatch-mcp` or `bcherrington/` references, leaving only historical mentions under `docs/archive/`.

## Impact
- Downstream users must switch to the `activitywatch-mcp` package name and GHCR images; compose services renamed to `activitywatch-mcp-*`.
- Git clone instructions and vulnerability reporting URLs now target the `auriora` organization.
- No runtime logic changes; rename is non-breaking aside from tooling references.

## Validation
- `rg "activitywatch" --glob '!docs/archive/**'` to ensure no stale references outside archives.
- `rg "bcherr" --glob '!docs/archive/**'` to confirm slug updates in active docs.
- Manual review of README quickstart and docker docs for correct commands.

## Follow-ups / TODOs
- Retag published Docker images under `ghcr.io/auriora/activitywatch-mcp` if not already available.
- Update release automation environment secrets to match the new GitHub organization if required.
