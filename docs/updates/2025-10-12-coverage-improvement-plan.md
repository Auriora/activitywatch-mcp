## Summary
- Documented a phased roadmap to raise overall coverage above 80% and ensure each source file exceeds 75%.
- Highlighted high-risk, low-coverage modules and mapped targeted test additions per area.
- Recorded applied repository rules for transparency and future implementation tracking.

## Changes
- Captured five-phase coverage uplift plan covering utilities/config loaders, client APIs, core services, transports, and enforcement steps.
- Identified concrete test scenarios for each low-coverage file (e.g., error branches, configuration fallbacks, transport lifecycle paths).
- Logged rule references: `.augment/rules/preferences.md` (priority 50) and `.augment/rules/testing.md` (priority 25).

## Impact
- Provides actionable guidance for upcoming test work to meet coverage thresholds.
- Reduces risk of missing critical error paths or configuration behaviours in production.
- Establishes documentation anchor for coordinating multi-phase testing efforts.

## Validation
- No code executed; plan derived from reviewing current coverage report and existing test suites.
- Referenced `npm run test:coverage` output supplied by user.

## Follow-ups / TODOs
- Execute outlined phases sequentially, updating tests and monitoring coverage after each phase.
- Add Vitest coverage thresholds (global ≥80%, per-file ≥75%) once targets are achieved.
- Track progress in future docs/updates entries as phases complete.

- Rules consulted: `.augment/rules/preferences.md`, `.augment/rules/testing.md`
