## Summary
- Expanded HTTP/SSE documentation to clarify how multiple instances behave and how port collisions are handled.
- Highlighted session-level isolation semantics so hosts sharing a server know their state remains separate.
- Noted that stdio launches stay in the foreground, enabling one process per host client without background daemons.
- Consolidated root documentation into `docs/` so HTTP setup guidance lives alongside the rest of the developer docs.

## Changes
- Updated `docs/developer/http-server-development.md` with helper scripts, admin endpoint usage, concurrency notes, and stdio lifecycle guidance.
- Removed the duplicate root files (`HTTP-SERVER.md`, `DEVELOPMENT-SETUP.md`) and pointed the README at the canonical developer doc.
- Added references to the listenerâ€™s `EADDRINUSE` exit behaviour for Docker/CLI use.

## Impact
- Developers running multiple transports simultaneously have clear guidance on port selection, failure modes, and session boundaries.
- Reduces confusion when several MCP clients hit the same HTTP/SSE server.
- No runtime changes; documentation only.

## Validation
- Manual doc review for structure and links.
- Verified relevant source sections (`src/http-server-cli.ts`, `src/index.ts`) to confirm behaviour described.

## Follow-ups / TODOs
- Consider adding diagrams for session flow in future architecture docs.

## Links
- Rules consulted: `preferences.md` (priority 50), `documentation.md` (priority 20)
