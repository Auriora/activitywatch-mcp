## Summary
- Introduced a clear docs structure with sections for Getting Started, Concepts, Reference, Architecture, Developer, and Updates
- Consolidated duplicated content for canonical events, AFK filtering, and categories into single authoritative docs
- Added a new Updates section for "What Was Implemented" task logs with a template and index

## Changes
- New folders: `docs/getting-started`, `docs/concepts`, `docs/reference`, `docs/architecture`, `docs/developer`, `docs/updates`, `docs/archive`
- New/Consolidated docs:
  - `docs/concepts/canonical-events.md` (merged design/summary/AFK)
  - `docs/concepts/categories.md` (unified category concept + metadata)
  - `docs/reference/tools.md` (complete tools API reference)
  - `docs/developer/logging-and-health.md` (operational guide)
  - `docs/index.md` (landing page)
  - `docs/updates/README.md`, `_TEMPLATE.md`, `index.md` (updates infra)
- Moved:
  - `docs/QUICKSTART.md` → `docs/getting-started/quickstart.md`
  - `docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md` → `docs/architecture/implementation.md`
  - `docs/MCP_BEST_PRACTICES.md` → `docs/developer/best-practices.md`
  - `docs/ACTIVITYWATCH_INTEGRATION.md` → `docs/reference/activitywatch-integration.md`
  - `docs/CATEGORY_MANAGEMENT.md` → `docs/concepts/CATEGORY_MANAGEMENT.md`
- Archived status/update docs into `docs/archive/`

## Impact
- Documentation is easier to navigate and maintain
- Single source of truth per concept reduces confusion
- Updates section provides a home for task-scoped implementation logs
- No breaking changes; links in moved files still need to be updated (Phase 2)

## Validation
- Verified folder creation and file moves
- Opened core docs to verify content consolidation
- Updated `docs/index.md` to link to the Updates section

## Follow-ups / TODOs
- Phase 2: Fix cross-links in moved files and update root `README.md`
- Remove duplicated explanations from implementation/integration docs and link to concepts
- Add "Last updated" headers where missing

## Links
- Updates Index: `docs/updates/index.md`
- Template: `docs/updates/_TEMPLATE.md`
- Tools Reference: `docs/reference/tools.md`
