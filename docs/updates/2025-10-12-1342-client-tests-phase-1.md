## Summary
- Added first ActivityWatch client unit suite covering success, API error, timeout, and connection failure flows per coverage roadmap.
- Extended shared mock client helper to generate reusable `AWError` variants and timeout conditions for upcoming services specs.
- Documented applied repository rules (`preferences.md`, `planning.md`, `testing.md`) and noted test runner behaviour for follow-up tracking.

## Changes


- Introduced `tests/unit/client/activitywatch.test.ts` exercising `ActivityWatchClient` request handling across key branches.
- Enhanced `tests/helpers/mock-client.ts` with method failure injection plus helpers for API, timeout, connection, and abort errors; updated companion helper tests.
- No runtime code modifications; test infrastructure only.

## Impact
- Improves confidence in client-side error handling before expanding service coverage.
- Provides reusable error factories for future specs, reducing duplication and clarifying expected error shapes.
- No production behaviour changes; CI impact limited to test runtime.

## Validation
- `npm run test:unit`
- `vitest run tests/unit`

## Follow-ups / TODOs
- Investigate Vitest runner silent failure (exits with code 1) and restore visible diagnostics.
- Expand coverage to additional plan items once runner reliability confirmed.
